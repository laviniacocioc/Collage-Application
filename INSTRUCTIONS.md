Andy Warhol-inspired Mona Lisa Collage
This project is a creative interpretation of Andy Warhol’s photo collage style, using the famous Mona Lisa as the subject. The program manipulates the image in three main ways:

1. Top Left Corner Image: The Mona Lisa is resized to one-fourth of the original image size and placed in the top left corner of the canvas. The smaller image maintains the essence of the original by adjusting pixel values accordingly.

2. 2x2 Image Grid: The resized Mona Lisa is replicated four times, forming a 2x2 grid that covers the canvas. The grid showcases the image in different positions, creating a Warhol-like repetition effect.

3. Negative Effect: Each image in the grid is given a negative filter, inverting the colors by subtracting the original pixel values from 1. This gives the images a striking, high-contrast look, paying homage to Warhol’s bold use of color.
